# Interactive Brokers Python TWS API Guide

## Introduction to the TWS Python API

### What is the TWS API?

The TWS API (Trader Workstation Application Programming Interface) is Interactive Brokers' solution for programmatic trading and market data access. It allows developers to build custom trading applications that can connect directly to IBKR's trading systems.

#### Key Features of the TWS API:

- **Real-time Market Data**: Access to live quotes, market depth, and historical data
- **Order Management**: Place, modify, and cancel orders programmatically
- **Account Information**: Retrieve portfolio positions, account balances, and P&L data
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Trade stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, and more
- **Global Markets**: Access to over 150 markets worldwide
- **Multiple Programming Languages**: Support for Python, Java, C++, C#, and more

#### How the TWS API Works:

The TWS API uses a client-server architecture where:
1. **TWS (Trader Workstation)** or **IB Gateway** acts as the server
2. Your **Python application** acts as the client
3. Communication happens through **socket connections** using IBKR's proprietary protocol

#### Benefits for Algorithmic Trading:

- **Automation**: Execute trading strategies without manual intervention
- **Speed**: Faster order execution compared to manual trading
- **Backtesting**: Test strategies using historical data
- **Risk Management**: Implement automated risk controls
- **Scalability**: Manage multiple strategies and instruments simultaneously

#### Prerequisites:

- Active IBKR account with API access enabled
- TWS or IB Gateway installed and configured
- Python environment with the `ibapi` library
- Basic understanding of financial markets and trading concepts

## Setting up the TWS Python API

### Installing & Configuring TWS for the API

Before you can use the TWS Python API, you need to properly install and configure either TWS (Trader Workstation) or IB Gateway. This lesson covers the essential setup steps to enable API connectivity.

#### Step 1: Download and Install TWS or IB Gateway

You have two options for connecting to the IBKR trading system:

1. **TWS (Trader Workstation)**: Full-featured trading platform with GUI
   - Download from: [IBKR TWS Download Page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php)
   - Larger memory footprint but includes all trading tools
   - Recommended for beginners and interactive development

2. **IB Gateway**: Lightweight, headless application
   - Download from: [IBKR Gateway Download Page](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php)
   - Minimal resource usage, no GUI
   - Recommended for production automated trading systems

#### Step 2: Enable API Access in Your IBKR Account

1. Log into your IBKR Client Portal
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Account Settings** → **Trading Permissions**
3. Enable **API** trading permissions
4. Set appropriate trading permissions for the asset classes you plan to trade

#### Step 3: Configure TWS/Gateway for API Connections

Once TWS or Gateway is installed and running:

1. **Access API Settings**:
   - In TWS: Go to **File** → **Global Configuration** → **API** → **Settings**
   - In Gateway: Settings are available in the login screen under **Configure** → **Settings** → **API**

2. **Enable API Connections**:
   - Check **"Enable ActiveX and Socket Clients"**
   - Set **Socket Port** (default: 7497 for TWS, 4001 for Gateway)
   - For paper trading, use port 7497 (TWS) or 4002 (Gateway)

3. **Configure Security Settings**:
   - **Trusted IPs**: Add IP addresses that can connect (use 127.0.0.1 for local connections)
   - **Master API Client ID**: Set if you want one client to control others
   - **Read-Only API**: Enable if you only need market data (no trading)

#### Step 4: API Connection Parameters

Key settings to configure:

- **Port Numbers**:
  - TWS Live: 7496
  - TWS Paper: 7497
  - Gateway Live: 4001
  - Gateway Paper: 4002

- **Client ID**: Unique identifier for your API application (0-32 for manual trading clients)

- **Socket Client Settings**:
  - Enable **"Download open orders on connection"**
  - Set **"Auto restart"** for production environments
  - Configure **"Logging Level"** for debugging

#### Step 5: Security Considerations

**Important Security Settings**:

1. **Firewall Configuration**: Only allow necessary IP addresses
2. **Authentication**: Use strong passwords and 2FA
3. **Network Security**: Consider VPN for remote connections
4. **Client Validation**: Implement proper error handling in your code

#### Step 6: Testing the Connection

Before proceeding to Python development:

1. Start TWS/Gateway and log in
2. Verify API settings are enabled
3. Check that the correct port is open and listening
4. Test with a simple telnet connection: `telnet localhost 7497`

#### Common Configuration Issues

**Troubleshooting Tips**:

- **Connection Refused**: Check if API is enabled and correct port is used
- **Authentication Failed**: Verify account has API permissions
- **Timeout Errors**: Ensure firewall isn't blocking the connection
- **Multiple Connections**: Each client needs a unique Client ID

#### Production vs Paper Trading

**Paper Trading Setup**:
- Use for testing and development
- No real money at risk
- Same API functionality as live trading
- Separate port numbers (7497 for TWS, 4002 for Gateway)

**Live Trading Setup**:
- Use only after thorough testing
- Implement proper risk management
- Monitor positions and orders carefully
- Use ports 7496 (TWS) or 4001 (Gateway)
