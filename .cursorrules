# Instructions

- During you interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 
- You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the `scratchpad` section, clear old unrelated tasks if necessary. Understand the new task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task, then update the `scratchpad`. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
- Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask. Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the scratchpad to reflect and plan. The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

## task specified instructions
- You need to read interactive brokers' API tutorial and write it down in a markdown file under TWS_API_Python_Guide.md under ./knowledge_bank.
- When you write it down, consider the format. The format should be easy to read for human and also for LLM.
- Read the webpage by your intelligence, do not try to read it using a program.
- Take into consider that I will need to let LLM to refer to the md file to write code.
